# Unreleased — pending notes for the next version bump

> Scratchpad for changelog items accumulated between releases. When running
> `/mpi-version-bump`, fold every item below into the new
> `RELEASE_NOTES['<newVersion>']` entry in `js/data/releaseNotes.js` and the
> archival `docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-v<newVersion>.md`, then clear this file
> back to the header.
>
> **Cleared 2026-10-06 at the 2.0.1 publish (MPI-1026).** The one item here (the Settings
> microphone, MPI-1034) was folded into `RELEASE_NOTES['2.0.1']` and
> `docs/releases/2026-10-06-v2.0.1.md`; the other six 2.0.1 fixes never passed through this
> file and were written into those two files straight from their commits.
>
> **Cleared 2026-10-04 at the 2.0.0 bump (MPI-595).** Every item was folded into
> `RELEASE_NOTES['2.0.0']` and `docs/releases/2026-10-04-v2.0.0.md`, cut to one or two
> lines each; the Known issues lines (release body only, never `releaseNotes.js`) moved to
> that archival note's last section. The 1.6.x private-build entries were deleted, not
> folded: their content was already here.
>
> **Cleared 2026-08-15 after 1.4.2 shipped.** All nine items (4 new + 5 fixes) were
> folded into `RELEASE_NOTES['1.4.2']` and `docs/releases/2026-08-15-v1.4.2.md`.
>
> **Cleared 2026-08-11 after 1.4.1 shipped.** All nine bullets (1 new + 8 fixes)
> were folded into `RELEASE_NOTES['1.4.1']` and
> `docs/releases/2026-08-11-v1.4.1.md`, including the first-run entry an earlier
> commit (`e2b0ddbf`) had filed for 1.5.0 — Fabio retargeted the whole scratchpad
> at the patch, because nothing pending was a feature.
>
> **The reset is part of the bump and it got missed in 1.4.0** — the fold ran, the
> clear did not, which would have re-folded all of 1.4.0 into the next version and
> shipped every bullet twice. If you are folding a release and this file still holds
> the last one's items, that is the bug, not a backlog.
>
> **KEEP EVERY BULLET SHORT.** One or two lines: what it is, and why the user would care.
> The rule and what it looks like are in `docs/releases/README.md` § Content → "Length".
>
> **Before writing a "used to / previously / no longer" claim, check it against the
> last released tag** (`git show v<prev>:<path>`), per bullet. Code that changed two
> or three times inside one unreleased version reads like user-visible history but
> never shipped, and the entry is then simply false. Full gate:
> `.claude/skills/mpi-release/references/copy-review.md` § Gate 0.


## Fixes

- **Compare labels each side with its History name.** An imported image showed its full file path instead.
