# MPI-1181 validation

## 2026-10-19 - wiring (session "Flux.3 integration 5")

Runtime graph `comfy_workflows/flux3_t2i.json` (generate_flux3.py from the raw; 111 nodes, upload
slots blank, wf_type 1, Turbo true) run on the bench ComfyUI 0.42.1 with only the app's injections,
`scratchpad/runops.py`, under gpu_lease:

| case | result | wall |
|---|---|---|
| t2i Turbo 1024x1024 | success, teapot | 12 s |
| t2i base 1024x1024 | success, visibly different (UNET switch works) | 48 s |
| edit Turbo, 1 ref, custom size off | success, top recoloured, rest intact, source 571x1021 | 21 s |
| edit Turbo, custom size on, 1024x1024 | success at 1024x1024; pillarboxed with a bare prompt, fills the frame with a `TARGET CANVAS: 1:1` line | 21 s |
| i2i Turbo 768x1344 denoise 0.6 | success | 12 s |
| upscale Turbo x1.5 | success, 840x1512 | 12 s |
| card image, base 896x1088 | success -> display/flux3-klein.webp (placeholder) | 45 s |

Not run on the runtime file: inpaint, detail (need a mask; Fabio benched both in this exact graph,
and the generator only prunes/bakes defaults - prune keeps every branch upstream of Output_Image).

`npm test`: first run 3423/3429, 4 fails all from this change (pinned rank order; a comment
containing "motion" inside the H3 hint slice) - fixed. Re-run: see below.

Not done yet: in-app run per op (the app engine reads G:/CubricModels, 8.7 GB free, weights sit in
C:/AI), R2 upload (needs Fabio's yes), agent guide (comes with the flux-3 recipe), progressStages
count, Boxes, Pod smoke.
